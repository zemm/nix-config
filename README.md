# My Nix configs

## Inspiration

Heavily inspired by
- https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-config
- https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-config

Better look those instead of this, as this is only for my personal use, and not so polished.


## Usage

```make
# Apply system configs
$ make system

# Apply home configs
$ make home

# Update the lockfile
$ make update
```
